### Q: 4.1 Three similar archaeological projects:

We have successfully completed hundreds of projects for a wide range of clients in the residential, commercial, and infrastructure sectors. Summaries of three comparable projects are provided below. Full case studies are available upon request. --- Case Study 1: Urban Residential Development, Anytown - Site type: Complex urban, multi-period archaeology. - Context: Large-scale residential development on a historically significant site. - Objectives: Evaluation, full excavation, and mitigation ahead of construction. - Methods: Trial trenching, open-area excavation, geoarchaeology, and specialist finds analysis. - Constraints: Aggressive construction programme, deep stratigraphy, and public engagement requirements. - Outcomes: The site was successfully cleared for development on schedule. A major report was published, and the finds archive was deposited with the local museum. --- Case Study 2: Infrastructure Pipeline, County Lines - Site type: Linear infrastructure project across a rural landscape. - Context: 25km water pipeline scheme. - Objectives: To assess and mitigate the archaeological impact along the entire route. - Methods: Desk-based assessment, geophysical survey, and a rolling programme of watching brief and targeted excavation. - Constraints: Restricted working corridor, multiple land ownerships, and seasonal ecological constraints. - Outcomes: All archaeological requirements were discharged without delaying the principal contractor. Several previously unknown sites were identified and recorded. --- Case Study 3: Heritage Asset Management, Historic Estate - Site type: Designated heritage assets within a listed park and garden. - Context: Conservation and development management for a historic estate. - Objectives: To provide expert heritage advice and undertake conservation-led investigation. - Methods: Heritage statements, conservation management planning, standing building recording, and watching brief during repairs. - Constraints: Working within a highly sensitive historic fabric with a need for minimal intervention. - Outcomes: Enabled the client to secure planning and listed building consent for works while enhancing the understanding and conservation of the heritage assets.
