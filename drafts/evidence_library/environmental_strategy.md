# Environmental Strategy

Archaeo-Consult Ltd. is committed to minimising our environmental impact and promoting sustainable practices in all our operations.

- **Soil Handling:** All excavation and soil movement is planned to minimise impact. Topsoil and subsoil are stripped and stored separately in accordance with industry best practice to ensure viability for reinstatement.
- **Finds Conservation:** An appropriate specialist is consulted for any finds requiring conservation. On-site first aid for finds is undertaken where necessary before removal to a secure, environmentally-controlled facility for assessment.
- **Waste Management:** We adhere to the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle). Site waste is segregated, and we aim to recycle the vast majority of non-hazardous waste materials.
- **Carbon Footprint:** We strive to reduce vehicle miles through efficient project planning and remote working where feasible.
