# Carbon Reduction Plan

Archaeo-Consult Ltd. is committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2040. Our Carbon Reduction Plan outlines our strategy for minimising our carbon footprint.

**Current Initiatives:**
- Promoting remote working and digital meetings to reduce travel.
- Optimising project logistics to minimise vehicle mileage.
- Migrating to a fleet of electric or hybrid vehicles.
- Utilising low-energy equipment and office lighting.
- Operating a cycle-to-work scheme for employees.

Our carbon footprint is measured annually, and our plan is reviewed and updated to ensure we meet our Net Zero targets.
