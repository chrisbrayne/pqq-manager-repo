### Q: State your policy on the use of subcontractors.

Archaeo-Consult Ltd. primarily uses its in-house team for all core archaeological services. However, for highly specialised analyses (e.g., specific scientific dating, complex conservation beyond standard treatment), we engage a select network of approved and vetted subcontractors. All subcontractors are subject to our stringent quality assurance processes, hold appropriate insurance, and operate under formal contracts aligned with our project requirements and client expectations. They are managed directly by our Project Managers.
