- **Constraints:** Restricted working corridor, multiple land ownerships, and seasonal ecological constraints.
- **Outcomes:** All archaeological requirements were discharged without delaying the principal contractor. Several previously unknown sites were identified and recorded.

### Case Study 3: Heritage Asset Management, Historic Estate

- **Site type:** Designated heritage assets within a listed park and garden.
- **Context:** Conservation and development management for a historic estate.
- **Objectives:** To provide expert heritage advice and undertake conservation-led investigation.

### Q: 5.4 Environmental strategy including soil handling and finds conservation.

Archaeo-Consult Ltd. is committed to minimising our environmental impact and promoting sustainable practices in all our operations.

- **Soil Handling:** All excavation and soil movement is planned to minimise impact. Topsoil and subsoil are stripped and stored separately in accordance with industry best practice to ensure viability for reinstatement.
- **Finds Conservation:** An appropriate specialist is consulted for any finds requiring conservation. On-site first aid for finds is undertaken where necessary before removal to a secure, environmentally-controlled facility for assessment.
- **Waste Management:** We adhere to the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle). Site waste is segregated, and we aim to recycle the vast majority of non-hazardous waste materials.
- **Carbon Footprint:** We strive to reduce vehicle miles through efficient project planning and remote working where feasible.
