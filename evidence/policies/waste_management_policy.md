# Waste Management Policy

Archaeo-Consult Ltd. is committed to responsible waste management and adheres to the principles of the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle).

All site-generated waste is segregated into appropriate streams (e.g., general waste, mixed recycling, hazardous materials). We use licensed waste carriers for the disposal of all waste, with a target of diverting over 95% of our waste from landfill.

Site-specific Waste Management Plans are produced for all major projects.
